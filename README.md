## Clean Swift templates from Rubicoin

Since our decision in August 2016 we are using Clean Swift architecture in Rubicoin's iOS apps. These templates envolved from the original templates available at http://clean-swift.com as we internaly improve and change the architecture to fit our needs.

Highlights:
- Compliance with Rubicoin's code style guidelines.
- No _how to use it_ methods. (RTFM üòâ)
- Templates for BDD with Quick.
- Overall adjustments (compromises between speed and understandability of the architecture, sometimes it's just overkill)


## How to install

To install the Clean Swift Xcode templates, run:

> make install_templates

To uninstall the Clean Swift Xcode templates, run:
